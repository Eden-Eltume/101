Trying to determine the return value of tricky_number can be somewhat confusing, so lets break it down.
We're printing the return value of tricky_number by prepending #puts when we invoke the method.
As we look at the method, we can see the if/else statement. It has a conditional of true which means that the if clause will be evaluated every time.
