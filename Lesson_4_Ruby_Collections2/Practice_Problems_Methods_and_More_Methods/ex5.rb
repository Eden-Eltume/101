=begin
shift destructively removes the first key-value pair in hash and returns it as a two-item array. 
If we didn't already know how shift worked, we could easily learn by checking the docs for Hash#shift. 
The description for this method confirms our understanding:
Removes a key-value pair from hsh and returns it as the two-item array [ *key, value* ], 
or the hashâ€™s default value if the hash is empty.
